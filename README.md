# Serializer Class

## Overview

The `Serializer` class provides a simple solution for serializing and deserializing data using standard C# libraries. It allows you to easily write and read data to and from files, whether the data is stored in lists or individual variables, as long as they are serializable. This class uses `System.Text.Json` for serialization and deserialization, making it compatible with a wide range of data types.

### Key Features:
- Serialize and deserialize **any serializable object** to and from files.
- Supports both **list-based** and **individual variables**.
- Uses **standard C# libraries** to ensure compatibility across platforms.
- Easy-to-use methods for **saving and loading** data.
